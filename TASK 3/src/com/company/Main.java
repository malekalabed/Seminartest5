//many swedish kids learn a langauge called the "robber language" (rövarspräket). the langauge is sometimes referred to as a langauge game and cecame popular after the books about Kalle Blomkvist by Astrid Lindgerm. the principle is taht all consonants are doubled with an "o"
        // (still the intro). inserted in-between. So for example , an "n" would become "non" and a "s" would become "sos". Vowels are left as they are.
    }
}
//Example 1: cannon = cocanononon
//Example 2: boat = boboatot
//Example 3: treasure = tororeasosurore


//for easy translation here is a reference table


// A=A  E=E  I=I  M=MOM   Q=QOQ   U=U    Y=Y   B=B0B   F=F0F   J=J0J  N=NON  R=ROR  V=VOV   Z=ZOZ C=COC   G=GOG   K=KOK  O=O   S=SOS   W=WOW   D=DOD   H=HOH  L=LOL  P=POP  T=TOT  X=XOX


//Your task is to creat a program that reads a word and prints it translated to "Robber langauge"

// 1) the program shall have a method named getTranslation that takes as a parameter the word to translate and returns the corresponding " Robber Language" word.
// (still 1)) Hint: maybe the charAt(...) method can be used on all strings can come in handy here.


// 2)the program shall read a word (in English) from the keyboard, call the method getTranslation(...) with the read word as a parameter and finally print the returned "Robber langauge" word to the screen
// (Still 2) NOTE: The word shall not be printed in getTranslation method.


//3) the output of the program shall look like the example below (where text in bold (all caps in my case haiwan) is input from the keyboard)
//Enter a word to be translated: ANNA (read from keyboard)
//Robber language: anonnoa (not read from keyboard)

//the program must use atleast -One calss (Main)   - a method that takes one parameter and returns a value   -a loop    -an if or switch statement.
