        //youve decided to learn a new language and want to creat a program that helps you memorize new words each week.

        //1) the program shall first read five words and their translation from the keyboard. the reading shall look like below (where bold (in my case all caps nigga) text input is read from the keyboard)and shall by done using a loop
        //Enter word 1: FLOOR
        //tranlation for word 1: GOLV
        //Enter word 2: ROOF
        //Translation for word 2: tak
    }
    //2) the words and their translation shall be stored in two arrays

    // 3) when all the words and their translation have been read the program shall keep asking the user for translation, one by one, till the user gets them correct.this shallbe done using one loop that
    // still 3) that iterates over all the words and one inner loop that keeps asking the user for the translation of the correct words till the user get it correct

} // 4) the output shall look like the example below (where blod text (in my case all caps nigga) is the input read from the keyboard)
// Tranlate floor: TAK
//Translate floor: GOLV
// Translate roof: CAR
//Translate roof: BUSS
//Translate roof: TAK
//Great work!

//5) Finaly when the user manages to work his or her way through all the words a message "Great work!" shall be printed (as you see in the example)


//the program must use atleast  -one class (main)  -One two arrays  -one loop  -one if-statement
